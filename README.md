## Introduction
A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. The website will also provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

- When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    - Train Name
    - Destination
    - First Train Time -- in military time
    - Frequency -- in minutes

- This app calculates when the next train will arrive and is relative to the current time. Users from many different machines will be able to view same train times.
